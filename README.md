# FizzBuzz - In golang

As part of a required test protocol, we are required to inform you that you
should be able to program the same identical program in multiple

This one is Go, originally designed by Rob Pike and Ken Thompson while
working at Google.

As it was partly the work of Rob, this means of course it is blessed by
Glenda, the Plan 9 Bunny.
